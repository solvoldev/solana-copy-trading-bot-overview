### Step-by-Step Process:

1. Use the command `/parse_radium_creations 1d` to find migrated Pump Fun tokens over a 1-day period.
2. Use the command `/parse_ca_accounts` to extract all token buyers.
3. Click the **"Scan Wallets"** button. After analysis, youâ€™ll be left with 107 wallets out of 4436.
4. Select **SQ analysis** for the scanned wallets.
5. After SQ analysis, youâ€™ll have only **2 wallets left**. This drastically reduces your workload. Now, just review these 2 wallets and decide whether to add them to your copy trading.

### Working with the Excel Table

The bot outputs an **Excel table** with wallets. Hereâ€™s how to use it:

1. **Download the original Excel file.** Online versions of Excel wonâ€™t work correctly.
2. Open the file, and youâ€™ll see:
